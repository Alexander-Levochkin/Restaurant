# Restaurant
An imitation of a restaurant. Choose dishes from the menu, order them and look at how your order is proceeding. As a custom feature, while you’re waiting for your order, you’ll be shown advertisements which were chosen by an “Ads Manager”. It picks the best set of ads for you depending on the order duration and other criteria.

Uses:
1) Observer pattern to realize the behavior of the preparation of the order
2) Multithreading to keep the program and its components working until the user decides to close it
3) SOLID principles
4) Inheritance
